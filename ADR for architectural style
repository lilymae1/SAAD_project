Context: The symfony web applications architecture direction

My symfony app was originally built using the deafult monolithic structure 
-Synfony controllers handle HTTP and application logic.
-Twig templates are tightly coupled to the controllers.
-All synfony code lives inside of a singular code base.

This is a good approach but the app may need to be scaled so that we can have more users and more companies utilising my system
-As a result there may be difficulty testing as the domain logic is in isolation.
-There will be reduced flexibilty 

I aim to keep the deployment monolithic but the internal structure in a more layered domain-centric approach

------

Decision 

To make my application more scalable I will evolve the monolith architecure to follow the onion architecture pattern
-Domain layer
-Application layer
-Infastructure layer 
-Presentation layer 
//keep monolithic? explain how many users it would need to have to scale
