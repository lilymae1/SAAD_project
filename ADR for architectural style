Monolith 
- A monolithic architecture style for complaint managment system would be a simpler approach

- pros and cons 
-geeks for geeks 
-//pros
-The program is simpler to manage and implement since it is all contained in one codebase 
-//cons
-Since it is one codebase the entire thing has to be scaled all at once.

Context: The symfony web applications architecture direction

My symfony app was originally built using the deafult monolithic structure 
-Synfony controllers handle HTTP and application logic.
-Twig templates are tightly coupled to the controllers.
-All synfony code lives inside of a singular code base.

This is a good approach but the app may need to be scaled so that we can have more users and more companies utilising my system
-As a result there may be difficulty testing as the domain logic is in isolation.
-There will be reduced flexibilty 

I aim to keep the deployment monolithic but the internal structure in a more layered domain-centric approach
//keep monolithic and explain the amount of people that will be using the system as a way to justifiy this 

-User interface- the /publi][c and /template folders for the web pages
-Application logic 
-Data acsess layer /doctrine.yaml and /mirgrations (for the database)
-Database .env file (the actual database file)
-External dependencies composer.json (for my external dependedies like the amazon emails and push notifs apis) 
-Middleware security.yaml (firewalls etc.)

Decision 

To make my application more scalable I will evolve the monolith architecure to follow the onion architecture pattern
-//explain the layers on the monolith and how it will relate to my system 
//look at monolith layers and the the file structure 
- Becuase of symfony's default folder structure I feel it would be the cleanest and least complex to keep the architecture monolithic although it is a single code base.
-As it stands the complaint managment system should'nt have many users active on the system at one time so it may not need to be scaled until a few other companies decide to utlise the services.
